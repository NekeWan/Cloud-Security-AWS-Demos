# AWS BUDGETS

AWS Budgets is used for setting a budget so that you can be notified if you've gone past a free-tier limit.

This is the first thing you have to do, to avoid accidental expenditures.

It like setting an alarm on the maximum amount you want to spend.

On your console, navigate to AWS Cost Explorer, from there, click on Budgets, then click Create Budget.

Under Create Budget, you have to set a timeline, I set it to monthly budget and also configure a budget threshold.

When configuring the threshold, you set an alert which is going to notify you when the threshold is exceeded. You can also enable the alert to be sent to your email. 

I set mine at 70% threshold.
